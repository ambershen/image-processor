```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Development

The application runs with Vite's development server on the frontend and proxies API requests to the Express backend.

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3001` (proxied through Vite)

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables if needed
3. Deploy with automatic builds on push

The application is optimized for Vercel's serverless environment with:
- Serverless function handlers
- Memory-based file processing
- KV storage integration
- Automatic scaling

### Alternative Platforms

The application can also be deployed on:
- **Railway**: Full-stack deployment with persistent storage
- **Render**: Web services with automatic deployments
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Container-based deployment
- **Heroku**: Traditional PaaS deployment
